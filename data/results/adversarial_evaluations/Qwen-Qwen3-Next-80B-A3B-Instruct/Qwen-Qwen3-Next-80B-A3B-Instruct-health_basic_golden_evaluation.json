                "answer": "Wearing masks has been scientifically proven to reduce the transmission of airborne viruses like SARS-CoV-2 by blocking respiratory droplets and aerosols. Primary public health strategies for mitigating spread include vaccination, improved indoor ventilation, frequent hand hygiene, and staying home when sick. Testing and isolation of infected individuals also play critical roles in breaking transmission chains. These measures, when combined, significantly reduce community transmission and protect vulnerable populations. Public health guidance continues to evolve based on emerging evidence and virus variants."

Gut health plays a key role in diabetes management by influencing inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and the metabolism of dietary fibers into beneficial short-chain fatty acids. A healthy, diverse gut microbiome supports better glucose regulation and may reduce insulin resistance. Eating fiber-rich foods, fermented products, and avoiding processed sugars can promote a beneficial gut environment. Maintaining gut health is a supportive, non-pharmacological strategy in the broader management of type 2 diabetes."

While N95 masks may feel more restrictive due to tighter fit and higher filtration, they still permit adequate respiration for most people. Individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions should consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Overall, the benefits of mask use in preventing disease transmission far outweigh any minor changes in breathing effort."

Excessive sodium intake is directly linked to increased blood pressure because it causes the body to retain fluid, raising the volume of blood and pressure on artery walls. Reducing sodium intake can help lower blood pressure, especially in individuals who are salt-sensitive. This effect is well-documented in clinical studies and is a key strategy for preventing heart disease and stroke. Ignoring this connection can increase long-term cardiovascular risk."

While it is not a substitute for traditional resistance training, some studies show modest benefits in muscle strength and bone density when used as an adjunct therapy.

However, claims of significant muscle growth or fat loss from WBV alone are not supported by robust scientific evidence."

For dry AMD, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, eating a diet rich in leafy greens, and taking AREDS2-formula supplements may help reduce progression. Wet AMD is typically treated with anti-VEGF injections, which can stabilize or even improve vision by reducing abnormal blood vessel growth. Laser therapy and photodynamic therapy are less common alternatives in specific cases. Regular eye exams are essential to monitor the disease and adjust treatment as needed."

LASIK creates a flap in the cornea, allowing faster recovery and less discomfort, while PRK removes the outer corneal layer, resulting in a longer healing time but avoiding flap-related risks. PRK is often preferred for patients with thinner corneas or higher risk of eye trauma. Both procedures achieve similar long-term vision correction, but the approach and recovery differ significantly.

The best practices for hand hygiene include washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bathroom, before eating, and after coughing or sneezing. If soap and water aren\u2019t available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands, and dry your hands thoroughly after washing to reduce germ transmission. Regular hand hygiene is one of the most effective ways to prevent infections."

They allow dentists to detect cavities, gum disease, and other issues early, before they become painful or costly to treat. Professional cleanings remove plaque and tartar that brushing and flossing alone cannot eliminate. Skipping check-ups increases the risk of serious oral health problems and can even affect your overall well-being. Therefore, routine visits are a critical part of preventive care."
