Rapid testing, contact tracing, and isolation of confirmed cases further break chains of transmission. Public communication campaigns that provide clear, evidence\u2011based guidance help ensure community adherence to these measures. Together, these interventions form a layered approach that significantly lowers the risk of widespread infection."

Large studies have shown that people who undergo colonoscopy have lower rates of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality compared with unscreened populations. While the procedure carries a small risk of complications such as bleeding or perforation, these events occur in less than 1\u202f% of examinations and are far outweighed by the benefit of cancer prevention. Consequently, professional guidelines recommend colonoscopy at regular intervals for average\u2011risk adults beginning at age\u202f45\u201150."

PRK removes the outer epithelial layer entirely before reshaping the cornea, so the epithelium must regrow, which typically results in a longer healing period of several days to weeks. Because LASIK involves a flap, it may be unsuitable for patients with thin corneas or certain corneal irregularities, whereas PRK can be safer for those conditions. Both procedures aim to correct refractive errors, but LASIK generally offers quicker visual acuity restoration while PRK carries a slightly lower risk of flap\u2011related complications."

Its four chambers\u2014two atria and two ventricles\u2014create a sequential flow that moves blood efficiently from low\u2011pressure veins to high\u2011pressure arteries. The heart\u2019s thick muscular wall, the myocardium, contracts rhythmically to generate the pressure needed for circulation, while the semilunar and atrioventricular valves ensure unidirectional flow and prevent backflow. A network of coronary arteries supplies the myocardium with oxygen and nutrients, supporting its continuous activity. Together, these structural features enable the heart to maintain steady, high\u2011volume blood circulation essential for delivering nutrients and removing waste products."

When blood reaches the alveoli, hemoglobin\u2019s iron atoms bind to oxygen molecules, forming oxyhemoglobin; this reversible binding allows oxygen to be released where cellular metabolism requires it. Hemoglobin also carries a portion of carbon dioxide back to the lungs for exhalation, helping maintain acid\u2011base balance.
