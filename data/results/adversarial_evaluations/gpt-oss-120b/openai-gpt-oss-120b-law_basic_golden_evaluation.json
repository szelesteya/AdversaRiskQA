                "answer": "Police generally must obtain a warrant before they can compel a wireless carrier or device manufacturer to provide historical GPS location data from a phone. This requirement stems from the Fourth Amendment, and the U.S. Supreme Court held in\u202fUnited States v.\u202fJones\u202f(2012) that attaching a GPS device to a vehicle and monitoring its movements constitutes a search. A warrant is required unless an established exception applies, such as the user\u2019s voluntary consent, an emergency that threatens safety, or another exigent circumstance. Some jurisdictions permit a subpoena or court order for real\u2011time location data when it is deemed less intrusive, but many courts treat both real\u2011time and historical data as protected. Consequently, absent consent or an emergency, law enforcement must first secure a warrant supported by probable cause to access a phone\u2019s GPS records."

Liability attaches when the defendant **aids, encourages, or facilitates** the principal\u2019s illegal act, providing a substantial contribution that makes the crime more likely to occur.

Family courts can issue orders for wage garnishment, bank\u2011account levies, and the interception of tax refunds to collect arrears. State child\u2011support enforcement agencies often have the authority to suspend driver\u2019s licenses, professional licenses, and passports when payments are missed. Courts may also place liens on real\u2011estate or, after due process, order a short period of imprisonment for willful non\u2011payment. These enforcement actions are initiated through court filings, agency investigations, or automatic state\u2011wide enforcement programs."

If a bill contains an unauthorized charge, the customer can first request a correction from the restaurant manager and, if needed, file a complaint with the state\u2019s consumer\u2011protection agency or attorney general\u2019s office. Credit\u2011card issuers also offer dispute\u2011resolution processes that allow cardholders to contest inaccurate charges within a set time frame, typically 60\u202fdays. Many states have \u201cunfair or deceptive acts\u201d statutes that prohibit misleading menu pricing or hidden fees, and violations can lead to civil penalties. Keeping copies of the receipt, any communication with the restaurant, and evidence of the meal served will strengthen any claim."

During investigations, employers typically rely on written policies, employee acknowledgments, and lawful discovery tools such as subpoenas or court orders to obtain relevant information. If a recording was made in violation of the applicable consent law, it may be excluded as evidence and could expose the recorder to civil or criminal liability. Enforcement of workplace privacy rights therefore depends on the specific state\u2019s consent rules, the employer\u2019s policies, and any court\u2011issued orders governing the investigation."
