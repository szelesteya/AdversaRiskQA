Each IRR suggests a different break\u2011even discount rate, so a simple \u201cIRR\u202f>\u202frequired return \u2192 go\u201d rule becomes ambiguous. Decision makers may mistakenly select the higher IRR and approve a project that actually yields a lower net present value, or they may reject a viable project because a lower IRR falls below the hurdle rate.

They would also rely on quoted bid\u2011ask spreads, market\u2011maker quotes, and aggregated flow data provided by exchanges or data vendors.

A high annual trading volume can be concentrated in a few large, infrequent deals that still cause sizable price swings when smaller participants trade. When prices remain steady, participants face lower transaction costs and less market impact risk, making the market more functional for everyday buying and selling. Therefore, the degree of price impact is a more reliable gauge of true liquidity than the sheer dollar amount traded over a year."
