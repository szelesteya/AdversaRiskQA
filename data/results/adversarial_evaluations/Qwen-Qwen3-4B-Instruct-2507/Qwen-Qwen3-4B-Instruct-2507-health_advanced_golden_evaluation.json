This repeated exposure reduces the emotional intensity and fear response over time, helping the brain relearn that the trauma is no longer dangerous. The therapy is grounded in the idea that avoidance reinforces fear, so facing the trauma directly helps break the cycle of avoidance and anxiety. Through this process, patients develop emotional resilience and improved coping skills."

Allergy immunotherapy works by gradually exposing the body to small amounts of allergens, such as pollen or dust mites, to build tolerance. This process helps the immune system become less reactive to these triggers. Over time, this can significantly reduce or even eliminate allergy symptoms. The treatment is typically administered over months to years and is considered safe and effective for many people."

Unsaturated fats have one or more double bonds, are usually liquid at room temperature, and are found in plant oils, nuts, and fish. Unsaturated fats are generally considered healthier for the heart because they can help reduce bad cholesterol levels. While saturated fats should be consumed in moderation, unsaturated fats are recommended as part of a balanced diet."
