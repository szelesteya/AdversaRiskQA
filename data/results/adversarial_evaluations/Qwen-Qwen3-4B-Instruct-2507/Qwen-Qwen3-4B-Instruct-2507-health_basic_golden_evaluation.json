The primary public health strategies for mitigating the spread of airborne viruses include vaccination, improving ventilation in indoor spaces, wearing masks in high-risk settings, practicing physical distancing, and ensuring regular hand hygiene. Public health authorities also emphasize the importance of testing and isolation for infected individuals. These measures, when combined, are more effective than any single intervention in reducing transmission."

These vibrations stimulate muscle contractions through reflexive responses in the muscles and nerves, particularly in the lower body. While WBV can improve muscle tone, balance, and joint stability in some individuals, especially older adults or those with mobility issues, it does not significantly increase muscle mass or strength like resistance training does. Scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for building muscle is limited and often inconsistent. Most experts agree that WBV should be used as a complementary tool, not a replacement for traditional strength training."

Regular physical activity enhances the efficiency of the heart, allowing it to pump blood more effectively with less effort. It also helps reduce bad cholesterol (LDL) and increase good cholesterol (HDL), which lowers the risk of plaque buildup in arteries. Exercise contributes to better control of blood sugar and weight, both of which are important for cardiovascular well-being. Overall, consistent exercise is a key factor in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system."
