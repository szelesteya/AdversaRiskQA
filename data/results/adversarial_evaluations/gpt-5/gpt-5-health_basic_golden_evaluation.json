N95-type respirators have the tightest fit and highest filtration, which increases airflow resistance, so they can feel harder to breathe through and slightly raise breathing effort and perceived exertion compared with surgical or cloth masks. During vigorous exercise, especially with an N95, small drops in peak performance and comfort can occur, but oxygen saturation typically remains safe. People with significant lung or heart disease may tolerate masks poorly and should seek clinician guidance; if you feel unusually short of breath, switch to a lower-resistance mask, rest in a safe area, and get medical advice if symptoms persist."
