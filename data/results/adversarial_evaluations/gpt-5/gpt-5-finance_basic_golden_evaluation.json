                "answer": "Retirement accounts are for building savings during your working years so you can spend that money in retirement.  \nStarting early gives your money more time to compound, so small, steady contributions can grow much larger.  \nYou also capture more years of employer matches and tax benefits (pre-tax savings or Roth tax-free growth).  \nBeginning sooner means you can save less each month to reach the same goal and better ride out market ups and downs and inflation.  \nEarly saving uses annual contribution space you can\u2019t recover later, lowering the risk of coming up short."

                "answer": "Retirement accounts build wealth by shielding investment returns from annual taxes, so more of your money compounds over time. \nTraditional 401(k)s and IRAs reduce your taxable income now and defer taxes until withdrawal, potentially at a lower rate in retirement. \nRoth 401(k)s and IRAs use after-tax dollars, and qualified growth and withdrawals are tax-free, which can increase your lifetime after-tax returns. \nEmployer matching contributions are essentially free money that immediately boosts your savings. \nHigher contribution limits, automatic payroll deposits, and strong creditor protections also make it easier and safer to accumulate long-term assets."

It gives you access to negotiated rates, so you are billed at contracted prices rather than the hospital\u2019s full list charges, even if your deductible is not yet met. Emergency care is usually covered without prior authorization, with in\u2011network cost sharing and protections against most surprise balance bills in many systems. Insurers can also coordinate care, medications, and follow\u2011up, helping you get treated faster and avoid complications."
