These protections apply even in non-unionized workplaces and extend to conversations on social media if related to collective action. However, speech that is maliciously false, disruptive, or unrelated to workplace issues may not be protected. The National Labor Relations Board enforces these rights and can order remedies such as reinstatement or back pay for violated employees."

Investigators must typically have a valid reason for monitoring or collecting personal data, such as suspected misconduct, and must follow established policies and procedures. In many cases, employees must be notified in advance that monitoring may occur, especially in jurisdictions with strict privacy statutes. Violations can lead to legal action, fines, or lawsuits brought by affected employees or regulatory agencies like the EEOC or state labor departments. Enforcement often depends on the specific context, including the type of data collected and the jurisdiction\u2019s laws."
