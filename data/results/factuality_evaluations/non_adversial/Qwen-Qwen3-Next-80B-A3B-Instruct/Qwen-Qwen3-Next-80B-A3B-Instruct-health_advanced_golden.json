                "answer": "hormonal cycles can influence athletic performance in women by altering energy levels, muscle recovery, and endurance due to fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone. During the follicular phase, higher estrogen may enhance strength and aerobic capacity, while the luteal phase, with elevated progesterone, can increase body temperature and reduce glycogen storage, potentially impairing performance. Some women experience bloating, fatigue, or mood changes during menstruation, which may affect motivation and comfort during training. However, individual responses vary widely, and many athletes perform optimally throughout their cycle with proper planning. Tracking symptoms and adjusting training intensity can help women optimize performance across their menstrual cycle."

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) gels, such as diclofenac, can also reduce inflammation and pain directly at the site. Some people find relief with lidocaine patches, which numb the area locally. These treatments are often used alongside oral medications or physical therapy for better results.

Ezetimibe lowers cholesterol by blocking its absorption in the intestines. PCSK9 inhibitors, given as injections, significantly reduce LDL by enhancing the liver\u2019s ability to remove it from the blood. Bile acid sequestrants bind bile acids in the gut, prompting the liver to use more cholesterol to produce new bile.

                "answer": "SSRI medications work by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with mood regulation, in the brain. They do this by blocking the reabsorption (reuptake) of serotonin into nerve cells, making more of it available in the spaces between neurons. This enhanced serotonin activity helps improve communication between brain cells involved in mood and emotion. Over time, this can lead to improved mood, reduced anxiety, and relief from depressive symptoms. SSRIs are generally well-tolerated and are among the most commonly prescribed antidepressants."

                "answer": "Anti-VEGF drugs are injected directly into the eye to block vascular endothelial growth factor, a protein that promotes abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage in the retina. These injections help reduce swelling in the macula, improve vision, and slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Treatment typically requires multiple doses over time, with regular monitoring by an eye specialist. They are often used as a first-line therapy for diabetic macular edema and advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy. While effective, they do not cure the underlying condition and must be combined with good blood sugar and blood pressure control."

Minimally invasive procedures like sclerotherapy, laser therapy, and radiofrequency ablation are often used to close off affected veins. In more severe cases, surgical removal (vein stripping) may be recommended. Lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, weight management, and avoiding prolonged standing can also help manage symptoms. A healthcare provider can determine the best treatment based on the severity and individual health factors."
