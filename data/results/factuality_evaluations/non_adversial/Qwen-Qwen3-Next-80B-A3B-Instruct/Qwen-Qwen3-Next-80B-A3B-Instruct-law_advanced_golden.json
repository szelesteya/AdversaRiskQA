Additional provisions are found in Additional Protocol I of 1977, which extends these protections to non-international armed conflicts and clarifies the rights of detainees. These laws prohibit torture, degrading treatment, and forced labor, and require that POWs be released and repatriated without delay after hostilities end. The International Committee of the Red Cross plays a key role in monitoring compliance and providing humanitarian assistance. Violations of these conventions may constitute war crimes under international criminal law."

This typically occurs after a balancing test considers factors like the importance of the evidence, the severity of the privacy violation, and diplomatic relations.

Such claims are rare because governments often enjoy sovereign immunity, which protects them from lawsuits unless they have waived that protection. In some jurisdictions, compensation may be available through emergency relief programs or statutory funds, but these are not the same as legal liability. Victims should consult a legal professional to assess whether their case meets the strict criteria for holding the government accountable."

Flying within 5 miles of an airport without notification is illegal, and drones are strictly banned from flying over or near sensitive sites like power plants, military bases, and government facilities.

Courts typically require a showing that the information is highly relevant, material, and unavailable through alternative sources. Some jurisdictions offer limited legal protections, such as shield laws, but these vary by state and do not always apply in criminal cases.

States cannot impose restrictions that are arbitrary, discriminatory, or excessively burdensome without a legitimate public health justification. Fundamental rights, such as freedom of assembly or religious practice, may be temporarily restricted only if the measures are narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means available.

        "success": true,
        "answer": "Commercial satire in advertising is protected under the First Amendment if a reasonable person would recognize it as exaggerated or humorous rather than a factual claim. Courts apply the \u201creasonable viewer\u201d test to determine whether the audience would interpret the statement as satire or as a literal assertion of fact. Defamation occurs when a false statement of fact harms someone\u2019s reputation and is presented as true, so satire avoids liability by lacking the necessary element of factual assertion. The \u201cactual malice\u201d standard applies only if the plaintiff is a public figure, requiring proof the speaker knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. Ultimately, context, tone, and exaggeration are key factors in distinguishing protected satire from actionable defamation."

These agreements often prioritize the institution\u2019s rights while granting students certain attribution or licensing privileges.
