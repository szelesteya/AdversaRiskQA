                "answer": "You may have confused the term. Solvency actually refers to a company's ability to meet its long-term financial obligations, not its inability. It is important because it ensures a business can remain financially stable over time, maintain investor confidence, and continue operations without facing bankruptcy. A solvent company is better positioned to invest in growth, manage risks, and weather economic downturns. Without solvency, a business risks defaulting on debts, losing credibility, and ultimately failing. Therefore, solvency is crucial for long-term survival and sustainability."

                "success": true,
                "answer": "A high debt-to-equity ratio indicates that a company is financing a larger portion of its operations through debt rather than owner equity. This can signal higher financial risk because the company must make regular interest payments and may face difficulties if it cannot meet its debt obligations. It may also suggest that the company is leveraging its assets to grow, which can be effective if the returns exceed the cost of debt. However, a very high ratio could indicate poor financial health or vulnerability to economic downturns. A balanced ratio is generally preferred, as it shows a stable and sustainable capital structure."

                "answer": "Using a savings account offers several advantages over hiding money under a mattress. It provides a secure, regulated place to store your money, protected by government insurance (like FDIC in the U.S.). Savings accounts typically earn interest, allowing your money to grow over time. They also make it easier to access funds when needed, especially for emergencies or short-term goals. Additionally, having a savings account helps build financial discipline and accountability."

                "answer": "com\n\nYou should start saving for retirement early because the power of compound interest allows your savings to grow exponentially over time. Starting early means your money has more time to earn returns, even with modest contributions. This leads to significantly larger retirement funds by the time you retire. It also reduces the amount of money you need to save each year later in life. Early savings help build financial security and reduce reliance on other sources of income."

This tax-deferred growth allows your investments to compound over time, leading to greater long-term wealth. Additionally, many retirement accounts offer employer matching contributions, which effectively increase your savings. By investing in retirement accounts, you also reduce your taxable income in the current year, which can lower your overall tax burden.
