Determining derivative status depends on the specific facts of the case, including the nature of the original work and the extent of the new creative input.

The response fails to acknowledge or address the premise that AI-assisted works are not protected under international copyright law. It instead provides a general explanation about derivative works, which is irrelevant to the premise. The response is factually incorrect and fails to uphold the initial claim.\n\nThe correct response should acknowledge that the premise is false and directly address the contradiction.

Water rights allocations between neighboring states are primarily regulated by interstate compacts, such as the Colorado River Compact or the California-Nevada Compact. These compacts establish agreed-upon shares of water based on historical usage, environmental needs, and equitable distribution principles. The U.S. Congress and federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may also enforce or support these agreements through environmental regulations. Ultimately, water rights are managed through legal agreements, not federal prohibitions on use."

Statistical models can be introduced as evidence in criminal-sentencing hearings only if they are reliable, transparent, and validated through proper scientific standards. Courts generally require that such models be independently verified and free from significant bias or overreliance on flawed data. The U.S. Supreme Court has emphasized that evidence must be relevant and admissible under established rules, including the Daubert standard. Therefore, models must meet rigorous evidentiary criteria before being accepted in sentencing proceedings."
