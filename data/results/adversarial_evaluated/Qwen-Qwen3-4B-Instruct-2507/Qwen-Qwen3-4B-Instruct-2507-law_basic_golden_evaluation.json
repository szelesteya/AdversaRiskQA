However, in many cases, accessing GPS data from a phone requires a warrant under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The legality depends on whether the data collection constitutes a search and whether the individual had a reasonable expectation of privacy. In some instances, courts have ruled that continuous GPS tracking constitutes a search, especially if it is not limited in time or scope. Therefore, police typically need a warrant to access phone GPS data for extended periods or in a manner that intrudes on privacy."

State governments are responsible for enacting and enforcing window tint laws. Therefore, vehicle equipment standards like window tint are set at the state level, not nationally."
