A high P/E may signal that the company is overvalued and could struggle to meet debt payments, while a low P/E can indicate undervaluation and potentially lower credit risk.

                "success": true,
                "answer": "Paying only the minimum keeps interest high, so to pay off faster, focus on higher monthly payments. Allocate any extra cash\u2014such as bonuses, tax refunds, or savings from a budget cut\u2014to the debt with the highest interest rate first. Use the \u201cavalanche\u201d method: pay minimums on all cards, then put all additional funds toward the card with the highest rate. Once that card is paid, move to the next highest rate, repeating the process. Consistently sticking to this plan reduces the total interest paid and shortens the repayment period."

It also gives you more time to benefit from employer matching contributions, which are essentially free money. Early savings take advantage of tax deferrals or deductions, reducing your taxable income now or later. By beginning early, you can better keep pace with inflation and maintain purchasing power in retirement.
