If the officer determines the person is a national\u2011security or criminal threat, or if the individual has a prior removal order that was not complied with, expedited removal can also be used without judicial review."

This typically occurs in criminal or civil cases where the source\u2019s identity is essential to proving a claim, such as fraud, defamation, or national\u2011security matters.  Federal courts apply a balancing test that weighs the First\u2011Amendment interest in a free press against the litigant\u2019s need for the evidence, and many states have shield\u2011law statutes that may provide broader protection.  If the court determines the need outweighs the privilege and no alternative exists, a journalist may be ordered to reveal the confidential source."

Commercial satire in advertising is further evaluated under the Central Hudson test, which requires that the speech be lawful, non\u2011misleading, and that the government interest in preventing deception outweighs First\u2011Amendment protection. Defamation claims, by contrast, require a false statement of fact, fault (negligence or actual malice for public figures), and damages, and the Hustler v.
