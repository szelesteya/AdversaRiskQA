It applies to arriving aliens and to noncitizens in the U.S. who were not admitted or paroled and cannot show two years of continuous presence, as designated by DHS, when they are inadmissible for fraud/misrepresentation or for lacking valid entry documents (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C), (a)(7)). Judicial review is largely barred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(A), with habeas review limited under \u00a7 1252(e) to narrow questions such as identity, status, and whether expedited removal was lawfully applied. If the person asserts fear of persecution or seeks asylum, or claims U.S. citizenship, lawful permanent resident, refugee, or asylee status, expedited removal must pause for screening or review. Separately, Visa Waiver Program entrants waive the right to contest removal except to seek asylum (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1187(b)), which allows removal without immigration-court review but is distinct from expedited removal."
